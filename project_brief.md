# PROJECT 2: OPTION 2 - Restaurant Review

***

You should create a platform for reviewing restaurants (or something else), (think a mini version of [Tripadvisor restaurants] (https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants)) that meets the following minimum criteria:

## MVP

* Has a User model and user authentication.
* Has models for Restaurants and Reviews.
* Allow users to add, edit and delete restaurants and reviews.
* Users can only delete their own reviews or restaurants added.
* Is styled with Bulma, but doesn't look like Bulma.

## Extras

* Reviews must be moderated before being displayed.
* Incorporate Google Maps into your web app.
* Any other features you want!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.
* **Incude relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Tips

* Use your notes in the GitBook.
* Check out popular reviewing sites for inspiration.
* Check out the [CheeseBored] (https://cheesebored.herokuapp.com/) app, which is an authenticated RESTful app.
